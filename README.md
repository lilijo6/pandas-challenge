# Data Analysis
Based on the analysis of district-wide standardized test results the following can be concluded:
1.	There is a general tendency to have higher scores in reading than in math across all schools 
2.	Both math scores and reading scores tend to remain constant or close across the different grades for every schools. In other words, there is no big difference between scores in the 9th grade and scores in the 12th grade. 
3.	It can be noted that all top performing schools are charter schools and all bottom performing schools are district schools. This is further confirmed by evaluating the average grades and overall passing by type of schools, which shows again, that charter schools in significantly more successful in obtaining higher grades and especially higher overall passing rates.
4.	It cannot be concluded that the average schools spending per student plays a role in the overall passing ratio. 
5.	Finally, small and medium schools tend to have a significantly larger success in terms of overall passing and high grades than the larger schools.
